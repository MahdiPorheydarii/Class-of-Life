# Class of Life

## Overview

This C++ program is developed as a midterm project for the Advanced Programming course at the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST). The program aims to simulate fundamental biological processes and provide functionality to manipulate and analyze RNA and DNA sequences.

## Features

- **Biological Process Simulation:** Simulate essential biological processes, such as transcription, translation, and replication.
  
- **Sequence Manipulation:** Perform operations on RNA and DNA sequences, including concatenation, mutation, and reverse transcription.

- **Cell Simulation:** Model the behavior and interactions of cells, including cell division and cellular processes.

- **Genome Simulation:** Simulate the structure and function of genomes, allowing for genetic manipulation and analysis.

- **Animal Simulation:** Model the behavior and characteristics of animals, including reproduction.

- **Virus Simulation:** Simulate the life cycle and behavior of viruses, including infection and replication within host cells.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive command-line interface for easy interaction with the program.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (C++11 or later)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bioprocess-simulator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Class-of-Life
    ```

3. simply just run main.bat and it will compile and run the exe for you:

    ```bash
    main.bat
    ```
* Note that if you do not use g++ compiler, you'd have to compile it manually
